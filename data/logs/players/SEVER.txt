[7/10/18 11:52AM]	Turtle: um smithing could be boosted exp wise a bit 	
[7/10/18 11:52AM]	Turtle: ive got 87 mining and only 70 smithing 	
[7/10/18 11:52AM]	Turtle: orrr easier way 	
[7/10/18 11:52AM]	Turtle: to smith anything, just take away needed coal	
[7/10/18 11:52AM]	Turtle: and just make it so we can smith just with one ore	
[7/10/18 11:52AM]	Turtle: cause mithril ore and coal 	
[7/10/18 11:52AM]	Turtle: is 4:1 ratio 	
[7/10/18 11:53AM]	Turtle: i have to get 1.2m mining exp 	
[7/10/18 11:53AM]	Turtle: for like 200k smithing	
[7/10/18 11:53AM]	Turtle: yeah, 	
[7/10/18 11:53AM]	Turtle: for mithril is 1.2k exp per bar 	
[7/10/18 11:53AM]	Turtle: and minign wise is 	
[7/10/18 11:54AM]	Turtle: mining is 17k	
[7/10/18 11:54AM]	Turtle: so its 1.2k exp smithing to 17k mining 	
[7/10/18 11:54AM]	Turtle: rougly	
[7/10/18 11:54AM]	Turtle: per bar 	
[7/10/18 11:55AM]	Turtle: tell vali if he dont wanna give me membership for that dupe 	
[7/10/18 11:55AM]	Turtle: ill take like 500 coal	
[7/10/18 11:55AM]	Turtle: x[)	
[7/10/18 11:55AM]	Turtle: purely for smithing lmao	
[7/10/18 11:55AM]	Turtle: nope 	
[7/10/18 11:55AM]	Turtle: nothing is 	
[7/10/18 11:55AM]	Turtle: just the bare essentials	
[7/10/18 11:55AM]	Turtle: 1k ea 	
[7/10/18 11:55AM]	Turtle: would be nice	
[7/10/18 11:56AM]	Turtle: smithing is such a pain, especially for max	
[7/10/18 11:56AM]	Turtle: im gonna need like 20m+ mining 	
[7/10/18 11:56AM]	Turtle: for 99 smithing	
[7/10/18 11:56AM]	Turtle: what i think you should do 	
[7/10/18 11:56AM]	Turtle: so, mithril ore is 1:4 ratio 	
[7/10/18 11:57AM]	Turtle: 1 mithril ore mine = 5k. 	
[7/10/18 11:57AM]	Turtle: 1 ore mine =3k 	
[7/10/18 11:57AM]	Turtle: 4x3 = 12k	
[7/10/18 11:57AM]	Turtle: +5k	
[7/10/18 11:57AM]	Turtle: 17k	
[7/10/18 11:57AM]	Turtle: so i think each mithril bar you smelt 	
[7/10/18 11:57AM]	Turtle: should give 17k	
[7/10/18 11:57AM]	Turtle: exp 	
[7/10/18 11:57AM]	Turtle: or almost the same	
[7/10/18 11:58AM]	Turtle: and amounts vary per bar, of course 	
[7/10/18 11:58AM]	Turtle: yeah 	
[7/10/18 11:58AM]	Turtle: and i havent done wc fm	
[7/10/18 11:58AM]	Turtle: woodcutting or fm	
[7/10/18 11:58AM]	Turtle: but just like mining, it should be the same 	
[7/10/18 11:59AM]	Turtle: for sure 	
[7/10/18 11:59AM]	Turtle: but any dupes i find ill wait til 1 of you get on	
[7/10/18 11:59AM]	Turtle: nope 	
[7/10/18 11:59AM]	Turtle: #rspsunit 	
[7/10/18 11:59AM]	Turtle: :[)	
[7/10/18 12:01PM]	Turtle: oh and imo 	
[7/10/18 12:01PM]	Turtle: anything you buy from equip stores, etc	
[7/10/18 12:01PM]	Turtle: should be able to be sold to gen store	
[7/10/18 12:01PM]	Turtle: for same price	
[7/10/18 12:01PM]	Turtle: cause i accidently bought 500 rune bolts	
[7/10/18 12:02PM]	Turtle: oh btw	
[7/10/18 12:03PM]	Turtle: pest control, is hard af unless you got like 10 people 	
[7/10/18 12:03PM]	Turtle: lol 	
[7/10/18 12:03PM]	Turtle: erm idk how easy you guys want this server to be	
[7/10/18 12:04PM]	Turtle: but maybe add herbs into a shop? 	
[7/10/18 12:04PM]	Turtle: ik you can farm for em, but thats a pain too	
[7/10/18 12:04PM]	Turtle: dag kings dont work	
[7/10/18 12:04PM]	Turtle: cant even access em	
[7/10/18 12:04PM]	Turtle: ladder dont work	
[7/10/18 12:05PM]	Turtle: ye 	
[7/10/18 12:05PM]	Turtle: you got access to npcdrops.json?	
[7/10/18 12:06PM]	Turtle: 11732	
[7/10/18 12:06PM]	Turtle: should be id for d boots 	
[7/10/18 12:06PM]	Turtle: can you find out what drops em?	
[7/10/18 12:06PM]	Turtle: please :[)	
[7/10/18 12:06PM]	Turtle: okie 	
[7/10/18 12:07PM]	Turtle: i always thought nechs drop em	
[7/10/18 12:07PM]	Turtle: sec testing something 	
[7/10/18 12:08PM]	Turtle: eh	
[7/10/18 12:08PM]	Turtle: super-heating just as bad	
[7/10/18 12:09PM]	Turtle: high alch 	
[7/10/18 12:09PM]	Turtle: 32.5k	
[7/10/18 12:09PM]	Turtle: super heat, 3.2k magic and 1200 smithng	
[7/10/18 12:09PM]	Turtle: for mithril 	
[7/10/18 12:12PM]	Turtle: mhm 	
[7/10/18 12:12PM]	Turtle: eco you got down, especially cash wise	
[7/10/18 12:12PM]	Turtle: haha	
[7/10/18 12:13PM]	Turtle: at this rate	
[7/10/18 12:13PM]	Turtle: once you get a steady player-base 	
[7/10/18 12:13PM]	Turtle: it will take at-least a month 	
[7/10/18 12:13PM]	Turtle: for cash to be worth anything 	
[7/10/18 12:13PM]	Turtle: for the first month, ishhh	
[7/10/18 12:14PM]	Turtle: you guys need to make items sell-able to gen store 	
[7/10/18 12:14PM]	Turtle: for a semi-decent amount 	
[7/10/18 12:15PM]	Turtle: tbh the only really good money-maker 	
[7/10/18 12:15PM]	Turtle: is probably gonna be smithing mining	
[7/10/18 12:15PM]	Turtle: only at 99 each tho 	
[7/10/18 12:15PM]	Turtle: and thats with rune ore	
[7/10/18 12:15PM]	Turtle: what we gonna do with that tho	
[7/10/18 12:15PM]	Turtle: if we cant sell it 	
[7/10/18 12:16PM]	Turtle: for now, until then	
[7/10/18 12:17PM]	Turtle: can you spawn item 451	
[7/10/18 12:17PM]	Turtle: and trade me 1	
[7/10/18 12:18PM]	Turtle: please haha	
[7/10/18 12:18PM]	Turtle: actually wait sec 	
[7/10/18 12:18PM]	Turtle: 2363	
[7/10/18 12:18PM]	Turtle: trade 1	
[7/10/18 12:18PM]	Turtle: :p	
[7/10/18 12:18PM]	Turtle: 1 of each	
[7/10/18 12:18PM]	Turtle: 451, 2363 	
[7/10/18 12:19PM]	Turtle: so 1 rune bar 	
[7/10/18 12:19PM]	Turtle: can sell for 5k 	
[7/10/18 12:20PM]	Turtle: ore =4.2k	
[7/10/18 12:20PM]	Turtle: bar = 5k	
[7/10/18 12:20PM]	Turtle: rune platebody (99 smithing) = 26k 	
[7/10/18 12:21PM]	Turtle: 5 ea for platebody 	
[7/10/18 12:21PM]	Turtle: so your looking at rougly 145k per inv 	
[7/10/18 12:21PM]	Turtle: with 99 smithing 	
[7/10/18 12:21PM]	Turtle: gp wise	
[7/10/18 12:21PM]	Turtle: which would probably be the only good money maker atm	
[7/10/18 12:22PM]	Turtle: yea	
[7/10/18 12:22PM]	Turtle: and magic logs sell for like 200gp 	
[7/10/18 12:22PM]	Turtle: they sell for more in real runescape 	
[7/10/18 12:22PM]	Turtle: x[)	
[7/10/18 12:23PM]	Turtle: first id go through every skill that correlates to 1 another	
[7/10/18 12:23PM]	Turtle: re-work the exp so its fair 	
[7/10/18 12:23PM]	Turtle: thats the very baisic 	
[7/10/18 12:24PM]	Turtle: thats how you're gonna get a somewhat cash flow 	
[7/10/18 12:24PM]	Turtle: then once skilling is done, id go through npc drops	
[7/10/18 12:24PM]	Turtle: and put prices on those	
[7/10/18 12:24PM]	Turtle: but thats just my opinion haha 	
[7/10/18 12:24PM]	Turtle: anywho, im afk. shower time	
[7/10/18 12:25PM]	Turtle: combat wise, yeah 	
[7/10/18 12:25PM]	Turtle: skilling wise, no 	
[7/10/18 12:25PM]	Turtle: content wise, no 	
[7/10/18 12:26PM]	Turtle: yeah 	
[7/10/18 12:26PM]	Turtle: some maps need correct map files	
[7/10/18 12:26PM]	Turtle: slayer exp needs to be re-done 	
[7/10/18 12:27PM]	Turtle: cave horros give 2.2k each kill 	
[7/10/18 12:27PM]	Turtle: an easy task sometimes gives me 3k+ exp each kill 	
[7/10/18 12:27PM]	Turtle: cave horros = med task 	
[7/10/18 12:27PM]	Turtle: mhm 	
[7/10/18 12:27PM]	Turtle: i do med tasks, and get cave horros 	
[7/10/18 12:27PM]	Turtle: they shit for exp 	
[7/10/18 12:27PM]	Turtle: and im almost maxed cb	
[7/10/18 12:28PM]	Turtle: prayer is goodatm 	
[7/10/18 12:28PM]	Turtle: dbones give 11.2k or w.e	
[7/10/18 12:28PM]	Turtle: uhhhh 	
[7/10/18 12:28PM]	Turtle: spawn me a dbone	
[7/10/18 12:28PM]	Turtle: and i can figure it out	
[7/10/18 12:29PM]	Turtle: 11,520	
[7/10/18 12:29PM]	Turtle: gonna be a very rough estimate	
[7/10/18 12:29PM]	Turtle: so  	
[7/10/18 12:29PM]	Turtle: lvl 70 prayer	
[7/10/18 12:30PM]	Turtle: requires 63 dbones	
[7/10/18 12:30PM]	Turtle: sorry	
[7/10/18 12:30PM]	Turtle: 68*	
[7/10/18 12:30PM]	Turtle: 68**	
[7/10/18 12:30PM]	Turtle: 68 dbones give 780k prayer exp 	
[7/10/18 12:30PM]	Turtle: once dag kings and frosts, etc are added 	
[7/10/18 12:30PM]	Turtle: prayer will be a bit easier	
[7/10/18 12:31PM]	Turtle: i gotta go shower, afk for a bit	
[7/10/18 12:33PM]	Turtle: rfd?	
[7/10/18 12:33PM]	Turtle: nah not yet	
[7/10/18 12:33PM]	Turtle: but it works 	
[7/10/18 12:33PM]	Turtle: 'daddy' did it
